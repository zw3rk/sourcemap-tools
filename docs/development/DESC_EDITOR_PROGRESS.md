# .desc Editor Implementation Progress

## Completed Features âœ…

### Phase 1: Backend Message Handling
1. **Fixed deleteMapping handler** - Now correctly finds document line numbers from mapping indices
2. **Improved addMapping insertion logic** - Properly orders mappings by line and column within lines
3. **Enhanced document change handling** - Added debouncing for rapid changes

### Phase 2: Multi-Character Mapping Support
1. **Updated data structures** - Introduced CharRange interface to support character ranges
2. **Enhanced UI visualization** - Added CSS classes for range start/middle/end with visual continuity
3. **Implemented mapping creation for ranges** - Supports:
   - Single character to single character
   - Equal length range to range (maps character by character)
   - Different length ranges (currently maps first characters)

### UI/UX Improvements
1. **Swapped panels** - Generated on left with soft-wrap, Source on right
2. **Character-level selection** - Cmd+Click to toggle characters
3. **Visual feedback** - Blue outlines and background for selected ranges
4. **Arrow navigation** - Up/Down arrows navigate through mappings
5. **Improved semantic type detection** - Better recognition of brackets, operators, etc.

## Remaining Tasks ðŸ“‹

### Phase 3: Range Selection Features
1. **Context menu implementation** - Extract ranges from browser selection
2. **Mouse drag selection** - Click and drag to select character ranges
3. **Keyboard shortcuts** - Cmd+M to add selection, Shift+Click for ranges

### Phase 4: Additional Features
1. **Validation** - Check for overlapping mappings and boundary violations
2. **Export to source map** - Convert .desc to standard source map v3 format
3. **Undo/redo support** - Track edit history
4. **Search/filter** - Find specific mappings
5. **Coverage statistics** - Show mapping coverage percentage

## Usage Instructions

### Creating Mappings
1. Click "Add Mapping" button
2. Cmd+Click to select characters in the Generated panel
3. Editor automatically switches to Source selection mode
4. Cmd+Click to select corresponding source characters
5. Mapping is created automatically when both sides have selections

### Editing Mappings
1. Click on a mapping in the list to select it
2. Use Cmd+Click to modify the selected characters
3. Changes are saved automatically

### Multi-Character Mappings
- Cmd+Click multiple adjacent characters to create ranges
- Visual feedback shows continuous selections
- Equal-length ranges create character-by-character mappings

## Known Limitations
- .desc format only supports single-character mappings (multi-char creates multiple entries)
- Source index is currently hardcoded to 1 (single source file support only)
- Different-length range mappings only map first characters
- No undo/redo support yet

## Technical Notes
- Uses functional/state-free style where possible
- Debounced document updates for performance
- Character positions are 1-based (matching .desc format)
- Webpack build succeeds with all TypeScript checks passing
