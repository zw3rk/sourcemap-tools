# .desc Editor - Final Implementation Status

## âœ… Completed Features

### Visual Improvements
- **Selected mapping prominence** - Selected mappings now display with 90% opacity while others are at 10%
- **Connection lines** - Selected connections are thicker (3px) and more opaque
- **Character highlighting** - Selected mapping characters maintain full opacity

### Core Functionality
1. **Backend message handling**
   - Fixed deleteMapping to correctly find document lines
   - Improved addMapping with proper line/column ordering
   - Added debounced document updates

2. **Multi-character mapping support**
   - CharRange data structure for selections
   - Visual feedback with continuous selection styling
   - Smart mapping creation (1:1, N:N mappings)

3. **Selection methods**
   - **Cmd+Click** - Toggle individual characters
   - **Shift+Click** - Extend selection to clicked character
   - **Mouse drag** - Click and drag to select ranges
   - **Text selection + context menu** - Select text and use context menu
   - **Cmd+M** - Add current text selection to mapping

4. **Keyboard shortcuts**
   - **Arrow keys** - Navigate through mappings
   - **Escape** - Cancel current editing operation
   - **Cmd+M** - Add selection to mapping

5. **Validation**
   - Detects duplicate mappings at same generated position
   - Warns about multiple mappings to same source position
   - Validates line/column bounds
   - Shows errors and warnings in status area

### UI/UX Polish
- Swapped panels (Generated left with soft-wrap, Source right)
- Color-coded mappings with consistent palette
- Range selection visual feedback (start/middle/end styling)
- Clear editing status messages
- Responsive connection drawing

## ðŸš§ Remaining Task

### Export to Source Map
The only remaining feature is exporting to standard source map v3 format. This requires:
- Base64 VLQ encoding implementation
- Proper mappings string generation
- Source map JSON structure

## Usage Guide

### Creating Mappings
1. Click "Add Mapping" or start selecting generated characters
2. Select characters using any method:
   - Cmd+Click individual characters
   - Click and drag for ranges
   - Select text and press Cmd+M
3. Editor switches to source selection automatically
4. Select corresponding source characters
5. Mapping creates automatically when both sides selected

### Editing Mappings
- Click mapping in list to select
- Use Cmd+Click to modify character selections
- Delete button removes selected mapping
- Arrow keys navigate mapping list

### Validation
- Click "Validate" to check all mappings
- Errors show in red (duplicate positions, out of bounds)
- Warnings show in yellow (multiple mappings to same source)

## Technical Achievement
- Functional programming style maintained
- TypeScript compilation successful
- Responsive performance with debouncing
- Clean separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling

The editor now provides a professional, intuitive interface for creating and editing source map descriptions with all requested features except source map export.
