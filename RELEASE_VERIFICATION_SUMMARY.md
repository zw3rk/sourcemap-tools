# Release Verification Process Summary

## Problem Solved
The CI was failing on the public repository because critical source files with linting fixes were not included when we squashed from develop to master for the v1.0.2 release.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed the Immediate Issue
- Copied all source files from develop to master
- Force-pushed corrected v1.0.2 release
- CI is now passing on public repository

### 2. Created Verification Scripts
Two development-only scripts to prevent future issues:

#### `scripts/verify-release.sh`
- Compares develop and master branches
- Categorizes differences into:
  - **Critical files** (must be synced)
  - **Other files** (need review)
  - **Excluded files** (correctly omitted)
- Runs linting check
- Shows detailed diff for critical files

#### `scripts/release-checklist.sh`
- Comprehensive pre-release checks:
  - Repository status
  - Version consistency
  - Code quality (lint, compile)
  - Test status
  - Critical files existence
  - Excluded files verification
  - Package scripts
  - CI configuration

### 3. Clean Implementation
- Scripts exist ONLY on develop branch
- No leaky references in Makefile
- Can be run from any branch using:
  ```bash
  git show develop:scripts/verify-release.sh | bash
  git show develop:scripts/release-checklist.sh | bash
  ```

### 4. Updated Documentation
- Added detailed release verification process to CLAUDE.md
- Documented which files are critical vs excluded
- Clear instructions for running verification

## Key Takeaways

1. **Always verify before releasing**: Run the verification scripts before any release
2. **Critical files must sync**: All source code, configs, and build files must be included
3. **Development tools stay private**: Scripts and dev docs remain on develop branch only
4. **Clean separation**: No references to missing files in public-facing code

This process ensures that:
- CI will pass on public releases
- No critical files are missed during squash merge
- Development tools don't leak to production
- Release process is automated and verifiable
